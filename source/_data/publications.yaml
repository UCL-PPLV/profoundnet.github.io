  abstract: >
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a recent networking paradigm that has become increasingly popular in the last decade.
    It gives unprecedented control over the global behavior of the network and provides a new opportunity for formal methods.
    Much work has appeared in the last few years on providing bridges between SDN and verification.
    This paper advances this research line and provides a link between SDN and traditional work on formal methods for verification of distributed software—actor-based modelling.
    We show how SDN programs can be seamlessly modelled using actors, and thus existing advanced model checking techniques developed for actors can be directly applied to verify a range of properties of SDN networks, including consistency of flow tables, violation of safety policies, and forwarding loops.
